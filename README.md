# Pressure Plotter - "Druckprogramm"

## Objective:

Create a program to open a data file of pressure values and plot them. It should:

- Be as simple as possible to use
- Open a text file of pressure values
- Plot said pressure values
- Have a user-settable pressure range
- Have a user-settable plot title
- Be usable without external libraries / software

This project is built on the QtWidget framework/library, as well as QCustomPlot. ÃŒnstalling QCustomPlot is fairly simple. Instructions can be [found here](https://www.qcustomplot.com/index.php/tutorials/settingup). Aside from the auto-generated content and the functions to edit the axis labels and plot title, the code is my own.
